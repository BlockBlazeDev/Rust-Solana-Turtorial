# Solana CLI

## Getting started with the Solana CLI:

### 1. Download the Solana Tool Suite (CLI)

Install the Solana Tool Suite by following [these instructions](https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools).   

Once installed, we must create an account. We do this by generating a new **public/private key pair**.
```shell
solana-keygen new
```

### 2. Configure an account for your device/application

### 3. Build a smart contract program

### 4. Deploy it!

## The Dockerfile:

Provided is a Dockerfile used to create the following image: [jpcaulfi/solana-alpine]().   

You can leverage this image to create a Docker container to conduct Solana business out of - such as deploying and even hosting/running an application.
