# Transfer Lamports

Two simple examples of transferring lamports (SOL).

### P2P Example

```shell
example-p2p
```
Example of two Solana accounts simply transferring lamports between each other. Just like you would if you sent SOL to a friend!

### Bank Example

```shell
example-bank
```
Example of a central payer system (such as a lending platform or bank) - where one account is paying multiple accounts some lamports.
